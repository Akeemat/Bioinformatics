**Introduction**

Welcome to my repository. Here, I provide an overview of a mini-project focused on investigating the relationship between the _ACE2_ gene and COVID-19 susceptibility or severity.

**Project activities**

1\. Identify and characterize known mutations of the _ACE2_ gene using data from the [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) and [dbVAR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/) databases.

2\. Determine the phenotypic associations of the _ACE2_ gene using data from the [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) database.

3\. Determine the genetic associations of COVID-19 using data from the [GWAS catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).

4\. Conduct population-level variant analysis of _ACE2_ by parsing the [1000 Genomes data](https://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/ALL.wgs.phase3_s), which is a catalog of human genetic variation obtained from 2,504 individuals from 26 diverse populations across Africa (AFR), East Asia (EAS), Europe (EUR), South Asia (SAS), and the Americas (AMR).

**Key Findings**

1\. ACE2 is highly polymorphic, having 25,124 unique SNPs and 530 structural variations.

2\. _ACE2_ variants of clinical importance are very few and are not related to COVID-19.

3\. Similarly, COVID-19 is rarely associated with _ACE2_ SNPs. Only four (0.5%) of the 885 SNPs of genome-wide significance were ACE2 SNPs.

4\. Population-level variant analysis suggests that _ACE2_ variants are largely uncommon across the five broad populations included in the 1000 Genomes project; however, the mean allele frequencies (AFs) may be driven by a combination of common and rare variants.
